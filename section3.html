                Through a registered account, individuals can post via the website or with compatible external applications
                such as <em>SMS</em>. These services are widely used in the U.S. and are also popular in different
                countries for digital communication. By using the site, users can upload text, images,
                and videos where they all go under the category of posts. They also have the option to
                categorize their posts based on topics using <em>hashtags</em> which are denoted by the
                "#" sign. On the other hand, the "@" symbol, when followed by a username, allows users
                to mention or reply to other individuals on the platform. The users then can interact
                with these posts by liking, reposting or, replying to the uploaded content. In 2015,
                X launched "quote tweet" (originally called "retweet with comment"), a feature that
                allows users to add a comment to their post, embedding one post in the other. Users
                can also be subscribed by other users' posts which are known as "following" and 
                subscribers are known as "followers".
