        <h4>Impact on Space</h4>
        <p>By February 2010, X users were sending 50 million tweets per day. This was the same year the first unassisted
            off-Earth X message was posted from the International Space Station. By late 2010, there were over a dozen
            tweets being sent from the space station which led to the development of "tweetups" where users can have VIP
            access to NASA facilities through their screen.</p>

        <h4>COVID-19 and Misinformation</h4>
        <p>In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, X experienced significant growth but also became a breeding ground
            for pandemic-related misinformation. The platform then began marking misleading posts and providing links to
            them to counter any form of delusion. In a notable incident, two tweets from U.S. President Donald Trump were
            flagged as "potentially misleading," prompting Trump to sign an executive order attempting to weaken law Section 230
            of the Communications Decency Act. This would allow X later to ban Trump, citing a violation of their policy against
            the glorification of violence. This led many debates to on the term of free speech. </p>

        <h4>Acquisition by Elon Musk</h4>
        <p>The platform also underwent a major transformation when it was acquired by
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk">Elon Musk</a> in October 2022 for
        <strong>$44 billion</strong>. In early 2022, he stated his concerns with the company's
        commitment to free speech and whether Twitter's moderation policies were undermining democracy.
        His vision to create the next "everything app" like WeChat was clear and he made major
        changes to the company to achieve this vision. He first started off by laying off
        about half the company (approximately 7,500). He then later revamped Twitter Blue
        and imposed limits on tweet views for unregistered users. He also changed the name of the company from Twitter to X, a form of rebranding that was done to attract new users. These changes stirred controversy, prompting criticism from various quarters which raised many questions within the social media space. Musk also reportedly made significant changes to Twitter's treatment of spambots with a more lenient content moderation policy.</p>
