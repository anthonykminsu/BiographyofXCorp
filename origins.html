        <p>X's story begins on one "daylong brainstorming session" held by the board members of a
            now-bought out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast">podcasting</a> company named
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odeo">Odeo</a>. During the meeting,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dorsey">Jack Dorsey</a>,
            the now ex-CEO of X, introduced the idea of using <i>SMS</i>
            for group communication. The original name of the application was named
            twttr after the five-character length of American SMS short codes. The company
            later changed the domain to twitter.com six months after the original launch.
            The first prototype was developed by Dorsey and Florian Weber, which was used
            as a service and later a base for the full version before the public introduction
            on July 15, 2006. The first post came from Dorsey on March 21, 2006, stating "just setting up twttr".</p>

        <p>X's long-expecting rise to popularity occurred in 2007 at the <a href="https://www.sxsw.com">South by
            Southwest Interactive (SXSWi)</a> conference. During the event, X's usage surged from 20,000 tweets
            daily to 60,000. Conference attendees constantly checked Twitter, with panelists, speakers, and
            bloggers mentioning and actively using the service. The positive feedback eventually led to the
            X staff receiving the festival's Web Award prize, expressing their gratitude in 140 characters
            or less, "we'd like to thank you in 140 characters or less. And we just did!". Between 2010 and
            2021, X underwent various redesigns, including the introduction of "New Twitter" in 2014 and
            changes in layout resembling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook">Facebook</a>.
            This was the case as their growth slowed in the following years with competitors like <b>Facebook</b>
            and <strong>Instagram</strong> continued to update and innovate their respective platforms.
            However, the platform persisted and became a key part of the 2020 U.S. elections during Trump's
            reign. In 2021, X began experimenting with projects like Bluesky, an open-source decentralized
            social media protocol and introduced new features such as Twitter Spaces, "super follows," and 
            ticketed Spaces.</p>
